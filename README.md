# Com_chem
Short scripts for computational chemistry calculations. Mainly designed for the softwares Gaussian09 and Gaussian16, http://gaussian.com/.


-boltzmann.py: Calculate the Boltzman distribution by giving the script a list of output files.  

-Change_basis_func.py: Change the basis set and functionals for a computational chemistry calculation in Gaussian by giving the script an input file (.com).

-Convergence_geo_opt.py: Plot the convergence of geometry optimization calculation in Gaussian.
